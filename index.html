The Growing Crisis (problem statement)
</h2> <p>use recent real world examples with specifics of impact</p> <br> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
Natural disasters are increasing in both frequency and intensity —
            from catastrophic hurricanes and wildfires to record-breaking floods
            and tornadoes. These events leave lasting scars on communities,
            displacing families, overwhelming local infrastructure, and causing
            billions in economic losses year after year. Despite heroic efforts,
            the government and local response systems are often stretched to their
            limits. Coordination stalls, resources arrive late or are
            misallocated, and critical information fails to reach the people who
            need it most. In the fog of crisis, time and clarity are everything —
            and too often, both are lost.

The Logistics Gap (problem statement cont)
</h2> <p>use real world examples and specific problems from recent events</p> <br> <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
What many don’t see is that effective disaster relief hinges not just
            on resources — but on the ability to move, allocate, and act with
            precision. Without clear planning, defined leadership, and operational
            discipline, even the best intentions can collapse under pressure.
            Delays in supply chains, confusion over roles, and fragmented response
            efforts can turn an already dire situation into a prolonged
            humanitarian emergency.

Founded by veterans, Integrated Response Group brings military-grade
          logistics and leadership to natural disaster zones. We coordinate aid,
          medical response, and operations where timing and teamwork matter
          most.
</p> <p>
We are former military operators with one mission: bring order to
          chaos when disaster strikes. Integrated Response Group was founded by
          veterans who’ve led under pressure. Today, we bring that same
          discipline to civilian disaster relief — from logistical coordination
          and medical deployment to tactical rescue operations. We don’t just
          respond — we organize, act, and lead.
